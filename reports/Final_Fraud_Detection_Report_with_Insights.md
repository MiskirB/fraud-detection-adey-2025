title: Fraud Detection for E-Commerce and Banking
---

# Overview

Adey Innovations Inc. is a fintech company tackling fraud detection in
both e-commerce and banking environments. The objective of this project
was to create accurate, interpretable fraud detection models and
communicate insights using explainability tools such as SHAP.\
This report summarizes the end-to-end solution for both e-commerce and
credit card fraud detection.

# Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

We used two datasets:\
1. Fraud_Data.csv (e-commerce)\
2. creditcard.csv (banking)\
\
For the e-commerce data, additional geolocation features were engineered
by mapping IPs to countries. Other engineered features included
\`time_since_signup\`, \`hour_of_day\`, \`day_of_week\`, and
device-related usage patterns. The banking dataset contained anonymized
PCA components V1 to V28.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights:

‚Ä¢ Fraud is more prevalent during specific hours and weekdays.\
‚Ä¢ Chrome and Safari had the most fraudulent transactions.\
‚Ä¢ Most frauds occurred in records with unknown countries.\
‚Ä¢ Fraud is uniformly distributed across days and times.\
‚Ä¢ Purchase values for fraud vs. non-fraud are similarly distributed.

# Class Imbalance Handling

Both datasets exhibited strong class imbalance. To address this, we
applied:\
- SMOTE oversampling for e-commerce\
- Class weighting for credit card dataset\
\
These strategies improved recall and precision on minority (fraud)
class.

# Modeling & Performance

We trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers on both
datasets. PR AUC was used as the main evaluation metric due to the class
imbalance. Results:\
\
‚Ä¢ Credit Card Dataset:\
- Logistic Regression: PR AUC = 0.7112\
- Random Forest: PR AUC = 0.8102\
\
‚Ä¢ E-commerce Dataset:\
- Logistic Regression: PR AUC = 0.4076\
- Random Forest: PR AUC = 0.6226\
\
Random Forest consistently outperformed Logistic Regression in both
domains.

# Explainability with SHAP

We used SHAP to interpret Random Forest model outputs. Key global
drivers included \`purchase_value\`, \`age\`, and \`time_since_signup\`.
SHAP summary, beeswarm, and waterfall plots were used to visualize both
global and local interpretations.

# Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)

PDPs helped visualize how specific features (e.g., \`is_weekend\`,
\`time_since_signup\`) impact fraud predictions. These findings aligned
with SHAP insights.

# Final Model Choice

Random Forest was selected as the best model across both domains due to
its strong performance, robustness to noise, and compatibility with SHAP
explanations. While Logistic Regression provided interpretable
baselines, it lacked predictive power on the imbalanced datasets.

# Business Implications

Deploying these models will help Adey Innovations detect fraud more
accurately while maintaining a smooth customer experience. The use of
SHAP ensures transparency, making the system auditable and trustworthy
for stakeholders.
